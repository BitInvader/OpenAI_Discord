# OpenAI_Discord chatbot

You will need to setup a couple of accounts:
https://discord.com/developers/ for bot token - free
https://developers.giphy.com/ for api key - free
https://platform.openai.com/account/ paid account for api key, have to pay for usage.

Will need to configure discord app in dev portal, enable 'privileged gatewate intents' in settings > bot

Install python 3.10.10 if you don't already have
Then install pips (in windows cmd): pip install discord.py openai requests 

Add the keys to the config.json file and run the app.
